The *Tiatnic* was one of the **most iconic tragedies** of all time. The titanic launched on *May 31, 1911* and finally set sail from Southampton on *Apirl 10, 1912*, with **2,240** *passengers and crew* on board. On April 15, 1912, after *unforunately striking an iceberg*, the Titanic broke apart and **sank to the bottom of the ocean.** Unforunately *taking the lives of more than 1,500 passengers and crew on board*.

We were provided a *dataset* of the Titanic of **passengers who survived or not.** *In addition* to other information such as; their class, fare ticket prices, passengers ages, and etc.

| Passenger ID | Survived | Pclass | Name | Sex | Age | Fare | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1 | 0 | 3 | Braund, Mr. Owen Harris | male | 22 | 7.2500 |

| 4 | 1 | 1 | Futrelle, Mrs. Jacques Heath | female | 35 | 53.1000 |

My first question I created was, how many many females and males survived the Titanic?

To answer this question I created a bar graph ...

- This graph clearly shows the correlation between females and males who survived the Titanic.
